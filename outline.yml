              - RESTFULL capible
                - Not limited to the browser
              - Still has a frontend
                - Not limited to not the browser
          - alexa
            - If you have an Echo device, please mute the mic now. 
              - You have been warned and I/we/no-one is to blame if we trigger it but you.
              - You only have yourself to blame.
            - What is alexa
              - Amazon's AI backed NLP service for Amazon
              - Alexa is the voice interface for many amazon devices:
                - Echo
                - Echo Dot
                - Echo Show
                - Echo Spot
                - Echo plus
                - Echo Look
                - Fire TV
                - Fire Tablet
                - Amazon app on your phone
              - And non-amazon devices are powered by Alexa
                - Invoxia Triby
                - Ultimate Ears Blast
                - Sonos One
                - Eufy Genie
              - Not an add, just wanted to show you the saturation of Alexa
                - Aside from amazon on my phone, I don't own an echo
                - Prefer Google Assistant and I have a Google Home
                - Alexa is everywhere and can be in anything, but the Google assistant is wherever I am.
              - Why focus on Alexa? probably doesn't need to be said.
                - Saturation as I just said.
                - Ease of development
                - I use Google Assistant but I don't have any published google voice apps.
                  - I don't have an Alexa enabled device, but I have built and published Alexa skills.
                - Alexa Skills Kit makes it easier to just pick it up and build it.
              - How does Alexa work?
                - Intents, Utterances, and Slots oh my!
                  - I had to do that.
                  - Intents
                    - The goal, function, or command you want to happen
                  - Utterances
                    - The words you expect a user to say to make the intent happen
                    - Really it is the training data for the AI part of all of this
                  - Slots
                    - Data that the intent needs to be fulfilled
                    - If the Intent is a function then the slot is the paramater
                    - Slots can be custom or one of Amazon's prebuilt data types
                    - Slots also control how Alexa asks for the data
                      - If Alexa needs a piece of data then it will ask the user for it, how the user is asked is controlled by the slot
                  - Fulfillment
                    - This is what happens when the Alexa thinks it know the intent of the user and all the data slots are filled
                    - This can be any https REST endpoint
                    - This can also be a straigt up lambda function
                    - Segway
                     - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_PT#/media/File:Black_x2_and_white_i2.jpg
                     - Maybe a gif of wiered al from the white and nerdy video
          - lambda
            - AWS serverless comput service
            - Serverless ooooooo
              - Of corse there is a server because there has to be a place for the code to run.
            - Lambda provides developers with a place to run simple single purpose scripts
              - This allows us to keep the code as simple as possible without having to worry about lingering effects and server maint
            - Multiple languages
              - php isn't one of them
              - I like python, it is well suited for this task
                - So many great libraries exist for python to do many amazing things in scripts
              - Others
                - Javascript
                - go
                - C#
                - Java
          - How does it all fit together?
            - User -> Alexa -> Lambda -> Drupal
            - Drupal -> Lambda -> Alexa -> User
            - It might sounds like lots of moving parts
            - Why put lambda into the flow, Drupal can do REST
              - Alexa needs an endpoint that can format the call responce a certain way
              - Lambda allows us a graceful fallback in case of Drupal availability allowing the service to scale better
            - Why use Drupal at all for this?
              - See the why Drupal section!
