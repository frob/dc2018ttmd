    - LMS Architecture
    - Need to deal with some prerequisite information so we all understand the goals of the project that I used as my test bed.
    - What is an LMS? An LMS is a Learning Management System.
    - It is software that allows for the organization and delivery of courses or training programs. If you have used buildamodule.com or drupalize.me then you have used a LMS.

    - Traditional LMS/Course schem
      - Curriculum or Lesson plan
        - Collection of Units or Modules
          - Collection of Lesson/Project/Assessment/Mini-lessons

    - Our custom LMS is structured as
      - Module -> Menu
        - Segments -> Nodes
          - Components -> Paragraphs Items
      - Lesson plan equivalents are built with select fields on the segment nodes.
