*Consider this*
- you have a client that wants to have a chatbot that tells one new joke every day.
  - Because, pew research says 46% of Americans use digital voice assistants
- This can be done multiple ways.
  - you can manage the jokes through the vendor console
    - log in every day at the same time, every morning, and copying in the joke.
  - you can have the response pre-programmed with hardcoded responses that get cycled through.

- Like most things there are a million ways to accomplish this task.
  - What if the content is more complicated than just a single joke.
  - What if you wanted to tell different jokes to different people.
  - What if you wanted to keep track of what jokes you told to each person so that you never repeat the joke.
  - What if you wanted to remember what joke you just told so the user can ask for it again.
  - What if you wanted to tell jokes in different languages?
    - This is huge by the way (Ovum expects 47% of Asia and Oceania by 2021, those are the developing markets)
  - What if you wanted to have people rate the jokes and then you can give them better jokes based on what they liked/disliked.
  - What if you wanted to allow for users to submit their own jokes.
    - What if you wanted to moderate these user submited jokes to keep them safe for all ages?
