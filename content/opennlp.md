      - I am not talking about Voice to Text
      - Voice to text has gotten really good due to the critical mass of training data and modern ML based approachs.
      - On its best day to voice to text was only around 60% accurate.
      - Now, Google and the like is in the high 90% of accuracy. That is rivaling human beings.
      - But voice to text isn't even Natural Language Processing.
      - That is converting voice audio to text strings.
      - NLP is when the computer doesn't just figure out what you are saying, but also what you mean. Or in the case of a Voice Assistant, what you want.
