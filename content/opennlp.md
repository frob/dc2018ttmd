# Open Source Voice and NLP

Natural Language Processing is hard.

>>> notes
- You might remember or have used Dragon Naturally Speaking by Nuance.
- That isn't what I am talking about.
- Dragon was strictly a voice to text converter. It uses an old style of voice recognition that requires extensive training.
- On its best day that approuch to voice to text is only around 60% accurate.
- The new approach from Google and the like is based on Nureal Networks and Machine Learning and in the stric sense of converting the spoken word to written text, it is in the high 90% of accuracy.
- But that isn't even Natural Language Processing.
- That is just voice to text.
- NLP is when the computer doesn't just figure out what you are saying, but also what you mean. Or in the case of a Voice Assistant, what you want.
- Nuance has been doing voice to text forever, they are getting into NLP.

I love open source.
So why don't we use open source to do NLP?
There are many people trying to do that. wit.ai for example is an open source alternative. But we can roll our own.
