*Cool Stuff*
- I believe presentations are more insteresting if you show the cool stuff first
- Originally this was going to be a live demo
  - I would Ask Alexa for something
  - It would respond
  - I would edit something in Drupal and ask again
  - It would respond differently

- But then I had a realization
- Everyone here has seen the node edit page.
- About that time my bosses boss came back with some interesting stats from SXSW

- @TODO add stats from Thors presentation
- Most of these numbers come from Christonpher Farrel's SXSW presentation I've got no strings https://www.slideshare.net/cwferrel/ive-got-no-screens-internets-screenless-future-sxsw-2018-90319757
- The cool thing he starts with is a prediction from Gartner
  - by 2020, 2 years from now, 30% of webbrowsing will be done without a screen.

*By now you have decided to build a voice app*
- you have a client that wants to have a chatbot that tells one new joke every day.
- This can be done multiple ways.
  - you can manage the jokes through the vendor console
    - log in every day at the same time, every morning, and copying in the joke.
  - you can have the response pre-programmed with hardcoded responses that get cycled through.

## So you have decided to build a voice app

- want to have a voice app that tells one new joke every day
  - This can be done multiple (bad) ways.
    - you can manage the jokes through the vendor console
    - you can have the response pre-programmed with hardcoded responses that get cycled through.
